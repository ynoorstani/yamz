		<h1> A Brief Background </h1>

		<p>
			My interest in web development stemmed from my passion for gaming. Between developing websites and playing video games, I admittedly spend most of my time in front of a screen. Some of my passions are writing clean code, creating awesome user experiences and filling up a fresh cup of coffee.</p>

			<p>
				I am a beginner programmer from Northern Virginia. For the
				past few months I have been enrolled in an online bootcamp,
				called Bloc. 

				Bloc is a renowned online bootcamp course
				which provides a coding mentor to teach you for up to 
				3-4 months in Front-End Web Development. I will graduating
				the program in the end of June!
			</p>

			<p>
				In my free time I like to code and pair program with my friends.
				My number one goal is enroll into Hack Reactor and someday become a Software Engineer.
			</p>

			<p>
				I will keep practicing my craft, and feel blessed to be working with substantially talented people.
			</p>

			<h1> A few fun facts </h1>

			<p>
				Huge anime fan, also love playing the guitar. My favorite films would have to be a split tie between The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. I love cats but why am I allergic to them...
				I was born and raised NYC and love the NY Giants! Learning how to cook but that has been a struggle.
			</p>

			<h1> A look into my life </h1>

			<p>
				During the warmer months, I enjoy traveling and hiking in upstate NY. Although the majority of the year, you will find me behind a computer screen. I am a passionate gamer which has had a huge impact on the start of my career, but that's a story for another time. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Throughout the years I've worked for places that feel the need to constantly burnout their employees with horrible requests and ridiculous timelines. Having been put through some bad experiences in my past, I've also had some great ones that allowed me to work with some amazing people who have played key roles in my career. I have worked very hard to get where I am today, but I'm just as passionate about where my career is leading me. The challenges that I deal with on a day-to-day basis I find meaningful and rewarding. Bottom line: I love what I do and I will do whatever it takes to further my career.
